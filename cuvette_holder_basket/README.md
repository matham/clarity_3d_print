Lightsheet microscope cuvette basket
====================================

These baskets are meant to hold cuvettes.

Design
------

They have a hole at the end where the cuveete top/bottom lays that is meant to be threaded.
You can then use a screw to hold the cuvette in place.

- The screw we use is `M3`, `.5` Thread, `8mm` long, and made from Nylon so it doesn't scratch (`92492A118` from mcmaster).
  The length is perfect to prevent overtightening the screw too much by users and damaging the basket
  or cuvette.
- The tapping bit is "Chip-Clearing Tap for Through Holes TiCN Coated High-Speed Steel, M3 x 0.5 mm Thread" (`2605A21` from mcmaster).
