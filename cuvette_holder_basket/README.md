Lightsheet microscope cuvette basket
====================================

These baskets are meant to hold cuvettes.

Design
------

They have a hole at the end where the cuveete top/bottom lays that is meant to be threaded.
You can then use a screw to hold the cuvette in place.

- The screw we use is `M3`, `.5` Thread, `8mm` long, and made from Nylon so it doesn't scratch (`92492A118` from mcmaster).
  The length is perfect to prevent overtightening the screw too much by users and damaging the basket
  or cuvette.
- The tapping bit is "Chip-Clearing Tap for Through Holes TiCN Coated High-Speed Steel, M3 x 0.5 mm Thread" (`2605A21` from mcmaster).

Cuvette
-------

- The cuvette for the standard size is 12.5 x 12.5 x 45 mm on the outside.
- The 20mm cuvette is 45 x 12.5 x 22.5 mm outside (`QF54`/`QF5402` at [cotslab](https://cotslab.com/product/qf54-20mm-lightpath-7ml-dual-path-lengths-quartz-fluorometer-cuvettes-with-ptfe-covers/)).

Printing
--------

For 3D printing, we found [shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com) to be the most cost effective for the basket and good quality.
We used `Gray PA12 Glass Beads` for the material and it's sturdy. It's best not to use any dye options to color it
because we found an instance where the dye dissolved into the solutions.
